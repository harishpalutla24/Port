    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Dedicated Software Developer.</p>
    <p> I am a passionate Java Developer with over 1.7 years of experience in designing, developing, and optimizing scalable and efficient applications. My expertise lies in building robust backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate, coupled with hands-on experience in developing and managing RESTful APIs for seamless system integration and communication. I bring a deep understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, enabling me to write clean, modular, and reusable code that drives application performance and maintainability.

I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions while working in Agile environments. My experience includes collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to design and implement microservices-based architectures, ensuring scalability and reliability. I leverage tools like Maven/Gradle for build automation, Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines, and Git for version control to streamline development workflows and accelerate deployments.

In addition to Java development, I bring strong skills in unit testing using JUnit and TestNG, ensuring robust code coverage and system stability. My ability to troubleshoot and resolve performance bottlenecks allows me to optimize application functionality and user experience. I am also proficient in scripting with Python and Bash, which helps automate backend processes and improve operational efficiency.

I am driven by a commitment to delivering innovative, reliable, and maintainable solutions that align with business goals. With a strong focus on continuous improvement, I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments that foster collaboration and technical growth.</p>
